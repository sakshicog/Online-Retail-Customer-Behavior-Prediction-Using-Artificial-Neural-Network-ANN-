Online Retail Customer Behavior Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
In the rapidly growing e-commerce industry, understanding customer behavior and predicting sales patterns is crucial for optimizing business strategies. Accurate predictions can lead to improved marketing efforts, better stock management, and enhanced customer satisfaction.
This project explores the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict customer behavior or sales in an online retail dataset. The goal is to use customer attributes and transaction data to predict whether a customer will make a purchase or to forecast future sales based on previous behavior.
The primary objective is to predict customer purchase behavior or sales figures using attributes such as the customer's demographics, browsing history, product details, and transaction records. This can help online retailers optimize personalized marketing, inventory management, and sales strategies.

Problem Statement
The customer behavior prediction problem can be framed as follows:

Objective:
To design and implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that predicts customer behavior or sales in an online retail environment based on a dataset containing various customer-related features.

Key Features:
Input attributes: Customer demographics (age, gender, location), product categories, transaction history, browsing behavior (e.g., items viewed, time spent per page).
Target output:
Binary classification: Whether the customer is likely to make a purchase (Yes/No).
Regression: The amount of future sales or total spend based on customer activity and behavior.

Goals:
Preprocess and clean the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing the data.
Train an ANN model to learn patterns and relationships between the customer attributes and behavior/sales.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy (for classification) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (for regression).
This solution can help online retailers enhance their customer experience, target high-value customers, and make data-driven decisions for future sales strategies.

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Dataset:
The dataset contains various customer-related attributes, including demographic information, browsing history, transaction data, and product categories. The target variable is either:
A binary label (purchase or no purchase), or
A continuous variable (total sales or customer spending).

Steps Taken:
Missing Data Handling: Rows with missing values were either removed or filled with appropriate statistics (mean or median).
Normalization/Scaling: Numerical features were normalized to a scale of 0 to 1 to improve ANN performance.
Categorical Data: Categorical features (like product categories or customer location) were one-hot encoded.
Feature Engineering: Features like "average time spent on website" and "total number of visits" were derived from the browsing history.

2. Model Design
Architecture:
A fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used, consisting of input, hidden, and output layers.

Input Layer:
Accepts normalized features with a shape of (samples, num_features).

Hidden Layers:
Several dense layers (typically 2-3 layers) with ReLU activation functions to learn complex patterns from the data.

Output Layer:
For classification (purchase prediction): A single node with a sigmoid activation function, predicting whether the customer will purchase.
For regression (sales prediction): A single node with a linear activation function to predict the amount of sales or spending.

3. Implementation
The model was implemented in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with an 80:20 ratio.

Model Details:
Input shape: (samples, num_features)
Hidden Layers: Two to three dense layers, with ReLU activation, and Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
Output Layer:
Classification (purchase prediction): A single node, loss='binary_crossentropy', activation='sigmoid'.
Regression (sales prediction): A single node, loss='mean_squared_error', activation='linear'.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer was used for its efficiency and adaptive learning rate.
Training: 50 epochs with a batch size of 32.

4. Evaluation
For classification tasks (purchase/no purchase), the model's performance was evaluated using:
Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified predictions.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Used for imbalanced datasets.
For regression tasks (sales prediction), the following metrics were used:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides a sense of the model's prediction accuracy by penalizing large errors.
